🚀 <strong>About Me</strong><br>
➡️ I’m an Associate Software Engineer with hands-on experience in building and maintaining web applications, primarily using WordPress. Over the past 5 months, I’ve worked on real-world projects in a startup           environment, focusing on website development, customization, and performance improvements.<br>
➡️ I have a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript (basics), WordPress, MySQL, and backend technologies like Java, JDBC, and JEE. Alongside my current work, I continuously revise and strengthen my backend skills to prepare for more challenging roles in top tech companies.<br>
➡️ I’m deeply passionate about the technology field and enjoy learning how things work under the hood. I actively upskill myself, practice problem-solving, and build projects to grow as a well-rounded software engineer.
